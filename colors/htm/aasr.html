<p class="title">The Explanation of the Girdle</p>

<p class="subtitle">From the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite<br>Fourteenth Degree or Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason</p>

<p>I also invest you with the girdle of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason.</p>
<p>The Girdle was used of old to strengthen the body and to enable man to continue and persist in his labors. It is therefore an emblem of activity, promptness and perseverance.</p>
<p>The Girdle was used to bind on the garments and prevent them from flying open and discovering our nakedness and is an emblem of charity, to the observance of which virtue you have been laid under new obligations.</p>
<p>The Girdle was also used for ornament and beauty. Let it be your endeavor to be adorned with and rich in those virtues which its various colors represent.</p>
<p>These are arranged by three, five, seven and nine.</p>
<p>The three are <span class="color blue">blue</span>, <span class="color red">red</span> and <span class="color yellow">yellow</span>, by a due mixture of which the primitive colors are formed.</p>
<p>The five consists of these three and a <span class="color green">green</span> and <span class="color purple">purple</span>.</p>
<p>The seven of the five with <span class="color white">white</span> and <span class="color black">black</span>.</p>
<p>And the nine of these seven and <span class="color grey">stone</span> and <span class="color orange">flame</span> colors.</p>
<p>The <span class="color blue">Blue</span> is an emblem of friendship and fidelity.</p>
<p>The <span class="color red">Red</span> of zeal.</p>
<p>The <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> which resembles gold, of wisdom, which said the wisest of Kings, is better than fine gold.</p>
<p>The <span class="color green">Green</span> is an emblem of hope.</p>
<p>The <span class="color purple">Purple</span> of dignity and majesty of conduct. <span class="color purple">Purple</span> is a Tyrian color and reminds us of the alliance into which you have now entered.</p>
<p>The <span class="color white">White</span> is an emblem of innocence.</p>
<p>The <span class="color black">Black</span> of modesty and seriousness of demeanor.</p>
<p>The next color is that of <span class="color grey">stone</span>, as stone is distinguished for firmness and durability; so this color teaches us constancy and decision of character.</p>
<p>The <span class="color orange">flame</span> color reminds us to cultivate ardent affection and charity. The various colors united in this girdle are expressive of that unity and the <span class="color olive">olive</span> interwoven of that peace which should link us together.</p>
<p>And as these colors shine in your girdle, so let the virtues they represent shine in your heart and life.</p>
