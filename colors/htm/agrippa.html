<p>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa: Of Occult Philosophy, Book I. (part 3)</p>
<p>Chapter xlix. Of Light, Colours, Candles, and Lamps, and to what Stars, Houses, and Elements severall colours are ascribed.</p>

<p>Colours also are a kind of lights, which being mixed with things, are wont to expose them to those Stars, to which they are agreeable. And we shall afterwards speak of some colours, which are the lights of the Planets, by which even the natures of fixed Stars themselves are understood, which also may be applyed to the flames of Lamps, and Candles. But in this place we shall relate how the colours of inferiour mixt things are distributed to divers Planets.</p>
<p>For all colours, black, lucid, earthy, leaden, brown, have relation to Saturne.</p>
<p>Saphire [Sapphire], and airy colours, and those which are alwaies green, clear, purple, darkish, golden, mixed with Silver, belong to Jupiter.</p>
<p>Red colours, and burning, fiery, flaming, violet, purple, bloody, and iron colours, resemble Mars.</p>
<p>Golden, Saffron, purple, and bright colours, resemble the Sun.</p>
<p>But all white, fair, curious, green, ruddy, betwixt saffron, and purple, resemble Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.</p>

<p>Moreover amongst the houses of the heaven [signes of the zodiac],</p>
<p>the first and seventh hath white colour:</p>
<p>the second, and twelfth green:</p>
<p>the third, and eleventh saffron:</p>
<p>the fourth, and the tenth red:</p>
<p>the fift, and ninth honey colour:</p>
<p>the sixt, and eighth, black.</p>

<p>The Elements also have their colours, by which Naturall Philosophers judge of the complexion and property of their nature;</p>
<p>For an earthy colour, caused of coldness, and dryness is brown, and black, and manifests black Choller [choler], and a Saturnine nature;</p>
<p>the blew [blue] tending towards whiteness, doth denote flegme [phlegm]: for cold makes white, moisture and dryness makes black:</p>
<p>reddish colour shews blood, but fiery, flaming, burning hot, shew choller [choler], which by reason of its subtilty, and aptness to mix with others, doth cause divers colours more: for if it be mixed with blood, and blood be most predominant, it makes a florid red; if choller [choler] predominate, it makes a redish [reddish] colour; if there be an equall mixtion, it makes a sad red. But if adust choller [choler] be mixed with blood, it makes a Hempen colour, and red, if blood predominate, and somewhat red if choller [choler] prevaile; but if it be mixed with a melancholy humour, it makes a black colour, but with malancholy [melancholy], and flegme [phlegm] together, in an equall proportion, it makes a Hempen colour: If flegme [phlegm] abound, a mud colour, if melancholy, a blewish [bluish]; but if it be mixed with flegme [phlegm] alone, in an equall proportion, it makes a citrine [citron] colour; if unequally, a pale, or palish.</p>
<p>Now all colours are more prevalent, when they be in silk, or in metals, or in perspicuous substances, or pretious [precious] stones; and in those things which resemble Celestiall bodies in colour, especially in living things.</p>
