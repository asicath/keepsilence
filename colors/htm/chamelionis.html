<p>HODOS CHAMELIONIS</p>
<p>CONCERNING THE TREE OF LIFE</p>
<p>This is the Book of the Path of the Chameleon - the knowledge of the colours of the forces which lie beyond the physical universe. Study thou well that saying of Hermes ‘that which is below is like that which is above,’ for if that which is below is conformed according to the Law of the Concealed One Great is his Name - be thou well assured that the closer thou adherest unto the Law of the Universe in thy working, by so much the more is thy Magical working just and true.</p>
<p>Recall what was said unto thee in the Ritual of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti. ‘Therefore, by the straight and narrow path of Samekh, let the Philosophus advance like the arrow from the Bow of Qesheth. Now Qesheth the Bow is the Rainbow of Promise stretched above the earth, whose name is formed from the letters of the Paths leading from Malkuth. If then it be by the Path of Samekh that the Philosophus should advance to the knowledge of the Adept, turning aside neither unto the right hand nor unto the left, whereon are the evil and threatening symbols of Death and the Devil, he must have a perfect and absolute knowledge of the Bow, ere he can follow the Path of the Arrow. But the Bow is of brilliant and perfect colour, whose analysis and synthesis yield others of the same scale, and hence is this book entitled “The Book of the Path of the Chameleon” - that Path, namely which ascendeth alone through the force of Qesheth, the Bow.</p>
<p>And if thy knowledge and application of the outer knowledge, which thou hast already learned, be faulty and incorrect how wilt thou be able to keep thyself from turning aside unto thy hurt? Therefore, learn not knowledge by rote only as an unreasoning child, but meditate, search out and compare, and to the end, see that thou think but little of thyself for only he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Magical knowledge is not given unto thee to tickle thy vanity and conceit, but that by its means, thou mayest purify and equilibriate thy spiritual nature and honour the Vast and Concealed One.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the first diagram of the Paths - the Sephiroth being in the feminine scale and the Paths in the masculine or King’s scale. It is the Key of the Forces which lie in Qesheth the Bow. Treasure it in thy heart and mark it well, seeing that therein is the key or nature. Meditate on it and reveal it not unto the profane, for many and great are its mysteries.</p>
<p>There are four scales of colour which correspond to the Four Worlds. They are:</p>
<p>King Scale	Atziluth	Wands	Yod	Fire</p>
<p>Queen Scale	Briah		Cups		Heh	Water</p>
<p>Knight Scale	Yetzirah	Swords	Vau	Air</p>
<p>Knave Scale	Assiah		Pentacles	Heh	Earth</p>
<p>The colours differ according to the World or aspect of the Great Name they represent:</p>
<p>Thus Samekh in:</p>
<p>King Scale	Deep Blue</p>
<p>Queen Scale	Yellow</p>
<p>Knight Scale	Green</p>
<p>Knave Scale	Grey Blue</p>
<p>Tiphareth in:</p>
<p>King Scale	Rose</p>
<p>Queen Scale	Gold</p>
<p>Knight Scale	Pink</p>
<p>Knave Scale	Tawny Yellow</p>
<p>The TREE OF LIFE for the use of an Adeptus Minor is compounded of the first two scales. The SEPHIROTH are in the feminine, passive, or Queen Scale. The PATHS are in the masculine, active, or King Scale. It thus represents the forces of ATZILUTH in the PATHS uniting the SEPHIROTH as reflected in the Briatic World, one of the possible arrangements of the powers inherent in YOD HE of the GREAT NAME.</p>
<p>First are the Feminine colours of the Sephiroth, the Queen’s Scale. In Kether is the Divine White Brilliance, the scintillation and corruscation of the Divine Glory that Light which lighteth the universe - that Light which surpasseth the glory of the Sun and beside which the light of mortals is but darkness, and concerning which it is not fitting that we should speak more fully. And the Sphere of its Operation is called Rashith ha-Gilgalim, the beginning of whirling (or whirls, or whorls), the Primum Mobile or First Mover, which bestoweth the gift of life in all things and filleth the whole Universe. And Eheieh is the Name of the Divine Essence in Kether. Its Archangel is the Prince of Countenances Metatron or Metraton, He who bringeth others before the face of God. The Name of its Order of Angels is called Chaioth ha-Qadesh, the Holy Living Creatures, which are also called the Order of Seraphim.</p>
<p>In Chokmah is a cloud-like grey which containeth various colours and is mixed with them, like a transparent pearl-hued mist, yet radiating withal, as if behind it there were a brilliant glory. And the Sphere of its influence is in Masloth, the Starry Heavens, wherein it disposeth the forms of things. Yah is the Divine Ideal Wisdom, and its Archangel is Ratziel, the Prince or Princes of the knowledge of hidden and concealed things, and the name of its Order of Angels is Auphanim, the Wheels or the Whirling Forces which are also called the Order of Kerubim.</p>
<p>In Binah is a thick darkness which yet veileth the Divine Glory in which all colours are hidden, wherein is mystery and depth and silence, and yet, it is the habitation of the Supernal Light. Thus is the Supernal Triad completed. And the Sphere of its Operation is Shabbathai, or rest, and it giveth forms and similitudes unto chaotic matter and it ruleth the sphere of action of the planet Saturn. Jehovah Elohim is the perfection of Creation and the Life of the World to Come. Its Archangel is Tzaphqiel, the Prince of the Spiritual Strife against Evil, and the Name of the Order of Angels is Aralim, the Strong and Mighty Ones who are also called the Order of Thrones. The Angel Yophiel is also referred unto Binah.</p>
<p>In Chokmah is the Radix of blue and thence is there a blue colour pure and primitive, and glistening with a spiritual Light which is reflected unto Chesed. And the Sphere of its Operation is called Tzedek or Justice and it fashioneth the images of material things, bestowing peace and mercy; and it ruleth the sphere of the action of the planet Jupiter. Al is the title of a God strong and mighty, ruling in Glory, Magnificence and Grace. The Archangel of Chesed is Tzadkiel, the prince of Mercy and Beneficence, and the Name of the Order of Angels is Chashmalim Brilliant Ones, who are also called the Order of Dominions or Dominations. The Sephirah Chesed is also called Gedulah or Magnificence and Glory.</p>
<p>In Binah is the Radix of Red, and therein is there a red colour, pure and scintillating and flashing with flame which is reflected unto Geburah. The Sphere of its Operation is called Madim or violent rushing Force and it bringeth fortitude, and war and strength and slaughter, as it were, the flaming Sword of an avenging God. It ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Planet Mars. Elohim Gibor is the Elohim, Mighty and Terrible, judging and avenging evil, ruling in wrath and terror and storm, and at whose steps are lightning and flame. Its Archangel is Kamael the Prince of Strength and Courage, and the Name of the Order of Angels is Seraphim the Flaming Ones who are also called the Order of Powers. The Sephirah Chesed is also called Gedulah or Magnificence and Glory, and the Sephirah Geburah is also called Pachad Terror and Fear.</p>
<p>In Kether is the Radix of a Golden Glory and thence is there a pure, primitive and  sparkling, gleaming golden yellow which is reflected unto Tiphareth. Thus is the first reflected Triad completed. The Sphere of its operation is that of Shemesh, the Solar Light, and bestoweth Life, Light and Brilliancy in metallic matter, and it ruleth the sphere of action of the Sun. Yhvh Eloah va-Daath is a God of Knowledge and Wisdom, ruling over the Light of the Universe; and its Archangel is Raphael, the Prince of Brightness, Beauty and Life. The Name of the Order of Angels is Melechim or Malakim, that is Kings or Angelic Kings, who are also called the Order of Virtues, Angels and Rulers. The Angels Peniel and Pelial are also referred unto this Sephirah. It especially rules the Mineral world.</p>
<p>The beams of Chesed and of Tiphareth meet in Netzach and thence in Netzach arises a green, pure, brilliant, liquid, and gleaming like an emerald. The Sphere of its operations is that of Nogah or External Splendour, producing zeal, love, harmony, and it ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Planet Venus and the nature of the Vegetable World. Jehovah Tzabaoth is a God of Hosts and of Armies, of Triumph and of Victory, ruling the Universe in Justice and Eternity. Its Archangel Hanial is the Prince of Love and Harmony, and the Name of the Order of Angels is Elohim or gods who are also called the Order of Principalities. The Angel Cerviel is also referred unto this Sephirah.</p>
<p>The beams of Geburah and Tiphareth meet in Hod and thence arises in Hod a brilliant pure and flashing orange tawny. The Sphere of its Operation is that of Kokab, the stellar light, bestowing elegance, swiftness, scientific knowledge and art, and constancy of speech, and it ruleth the sphere of the action of the planet Mercury. Elohim Tzabaoth is also a God of Hosts and of Armies, of Mercy and of Agreement, of Praise and Honour, ruling the Universe in Wisdom and Harmony. Its Archangel is Michael, the Prince of Splendour and of Wisdom, and the Name of Order of Angels is Beni Elohim, or Sons of the Gods, who are also called the Order of Archangels.</p>
<p>The beams of Chesed and Geburah meet in Yesod and thence ariseth in Yesod a brilliant deep violet-purple or puce, and thus is the third Triad completed. The sphere of its operation is that of Levanah, the Lunar beam, bestowing change, increase and decrease upon created things and it ruleth the Sphere of Action of the Moon and the nature of mankind. Shaddai is a God who sheddeth benefits, Omnipotent and Satisfying, and Al Chai is the God of Life, the Living One. Its Archangel is Gabriel the Prince of Change and Alteration. The name of the Order of Angels is Kerubim or Kerubic ones who are also called the Order of Angels.</p>
<p>From the rays of this Triad there appear three colours in Malkuth together with a fourth which is their synthesis. Thus from the orange tawny of Hod and the green nature of Netzach, there goeth forth a certain greenish ‘citrine’ colour, yet pure and translucent withal. From the orange tawny of Hod mingled with the puce of Yesod there goeth forth a certain red russet brown, ‘russet’ yet gleaming with a hidden fire. From the green of Netzach and the puce of Yesod there goeth forth a certain other darkening green ‘Olive’ yet rich and glowing withal. The synthesis of all these is a blackness which bordereth upon the Qlippoth.</p>
<p>Thus are the colours of the Sephiroth completed in their feminine or Rainbow scale.</p>
<p>Moreover, though the Tree of Life operates through all the Ten Sephiroth, yet it is referred in a special manner to Tiphareth. Also, though the branches of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil stretch into the seven lower Sephiroth and downwards into the Kingdom of Shells, yet it is referred especially unto Malkuth. Similarly with Netzach and Hod, the right and left columns of the Sephiroth are referred respectively thereto.</p>
<p>In Malkuth, Adonai ha-Aretz is God, the Lord and King, ruling over the Kingdom and Empire which is the Visible Universe.</p>
<p>Cholem Yesodoth the Breaker of Foundations, is the Name of the Sphere of the Elements from which all things are formed, and its Archangels are three: Metatron, the Prince of Countenance reflected from Kether, and Sandalphon, the Prince of Prayer (feminine), and Nephesch ha-Messiah, the Soul of the Reconciler for the Earth. The Order of Angels is Ashim or Flames of Fire, as it is written ‘Who maketh his Angels as Ashim Spirits and his Ministers as a flaming Fire,’ and these are also called the Order of blessed Souls, or of the Souls of the Just made Perfect.</p>
<p>The Three Archangels attributed to Malkuth with reference to Christian symbolism in regard to Our Father, Our Lady, and Our Lord. The following tables consists of a classification of the scales of colour in each of the Four Worlds. The first ten refer to the Sephiroth, and the remaining twenty-two refer to the Paths.</p>
