<p class="title">The Lecture on Colours</p>

<p class="subtitle">From Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia<br>Initiation Ritual II, Theoricus Grade</p>

<p>The distinctive task of the Theoricus, in the second Grade of our Society, is the study of the significance and
    symbolism of Colours.</p>
<p>At the beginning of His work of creation God said, “Let there be Light”, and there was light. This <span class="color white">White</span> glory of the
    Beginning was soon diversified, reflected in a myriad of rays from the air, fire, water and earth of the material
    world, and Man, in whom the work of creation culminated, became conscious of colours.</p>
<p>The rainbow in the heavens made manifest to him the whole range of colours, and he soon was able to distinguish the
    seven that were most evident, and which we know as <span class="color red">Red</span>, <span class="color orange">Orange</span>,
    <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span>, <span class="color green">Green</span>, <span
            class="color blue">Blue</span>, <span class="color indigo">Indigo</span>, and <span class="color Violet">Violet</span>.
    These
    colours of the rainbow are also seen on earth as well as in the heavens - we see them in our flowers and fruits, on
    our hills and in our valleys, in our metals, and on the birds and animals around us.</p>
<p>Of the seven main colours there are three that are, by common consent, more clearly perceived - <span
        class="color red">Red</span>, <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> and
    <span class="color blue">Blue</span>.</p>
<p><span class="color white">White</span> is the combination of all the colours, and all religions have attributed White and Light to God, by whatever
    name He may be called. <span class="color white">White</span> is an emblem of goodness and purity. The priests and ministers of almost all faiths
    have been clothed in white garments in token of their high office. In the Old Testament we read of the white robes
    of Aaron and the sons of Levi.And in the New Testament we read: “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in
    white raiment”.</p>
<p><span class="color white">White</span> is also the symbol of the beatific combination of love, innocence and faith which lead to purity, peace and
    perfection. The Diamond is the emblem.</p>
<p><span class="color black">Black</span> is the complete absence of Light and Colour and symbolises evil, the antithesis of all that is good, beautiful
    and true. It refers to loss, despair and death.</p>
<p>The three primary colours - <span class="color red">Red</span>, <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> and <span
        class="color blue">Blue</span> - have been attributed to three divine qualities, namely - <span
        class="color red">Red</span> to
    God’s Omnipotence, <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> to his Omniscience and <span
            class="color blue">Blue</span> to his Omnipresence, or, in other words, to his Power, Wisdom
    and Universality.</p>
<p>In relation to Man, the colour <span class="color red">Red</span> denotes courage, will and force; hence to dominion
    and power. It is also related
    to war and to each man’s fight with his passions. <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> refers to intellect and
    knowledge, and thus to wisdom, and
    it is emblematical of calm, peace and gladness. <span class="color blue">Blue</span> refers to honour, love,
    friendship and fidelity, hence to
    benevolence.</p>
<p>In the world around us we associate the colour <span class="color red">Red</span> with fire, with blood and wine and
    with the Ruby. <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> with the
    sun’s rays, giving life to all animal and vegetable life, with gold, corn and oil, and with the Topaz. <span
            class="color blue">Blue</span> with the
    vault of the cloudless heaven and the deep sea beneath it and with the Sapphire.</p>
<p>These three colours predominate in flowers and are supplemented by <span class="color orange">Orange</span>, <span class="color purple">Purple</span>
    and <span class="color violet">Violet</span>; and <span class="color green">Green</span> is the almost
    universal colour of leaves and growing shoots of all vegetation. In symbolism <span class="color green">Green</span>
    refers to hope, progress,
    evolution and regeneration. It is typified by the Emerald.</p>
<p><span class="color purple">Purple</span> has become associated with Imperial Rule and dignity from its combination of power and love. Its emblem is the
    Amethyst.</p>
<p><span class="color orange">Orange</span> has been referred to zeal and enthusiasm and to mental and moral development
    and self-control. <span class="color violet">Violet</span> is the
    colour referred to penitence, and <span class="color grey">Grey</span> is symbolical of humility.</p>
<p><span class="color brown">Brown</span> is the colour of a large part of the solid earth on which we live, and is associated with durability, firmness,
    constancy and self-abnegation.</p>
<p>So the varied colours by which we are surrounded in Nature and which show forth the beauties of God’s creation,
    reveal to us something of the Beauty of His holiness,which it is our aim to reflect as best we can in our own
    lives.</p>
