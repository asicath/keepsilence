<p>SRIA II, Theoricus Grade</p>
<p>"The Lecture on Colours"</p>
<p>The distinctive task of the Theoricus, in the second Grade of our Society, is the study of the significance and symbolism of Colours.</p>
<p>At the beginning of His work of creation God said, “Let there be Light”, and there was light. This White glory of the Beginning was soon diversified, reflected in a myriad of rays from the air, fire, water and earth of the material world, and Man, in whom the work of creation culminated, became conscious of colours.</p>
<p>The rainbow in the heavens made manifest to him the whole range of colours, and he soon was able to distinguish the seven that were most evident, and which we know as Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. These colours of the rainbow are also seen on earth as well as in the heavens - we see them in our flowers and fruits, on our hills and in our valleys, in our metals, and on the birds and animals around us.</p>
<p>Of the seven main colours there are three that are, by common consent, more clearly perceived - Red, Yellow and Blue.</p>
<p>White is the combination of all the colours, and all religions have attributed White and Light to God, by whatever name He may be called. White is an emblem of goodness and purity. The priests and ministers of almost all faiths have been clothed in white garments in token of their high office. In the Old Testament we read of the white robes of Aaron and the sons of Levi.And in the New Testament we read: “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment”.</p>
<p>White is also the symbol of the beatific combination of love, innocence and faith which lead to purity, peace and perfection. The Diamond is the emblem.</p>
<p>Black is the complete absence of Light and Colour and symbolises evil, the antithesis of all that is good, beautiful and true. It refers to loss, despair and death.</p>
<p>The three primary colours - Red, Yellow and Blue - have been attributed to three divine qualities, namely - Red to God’s Omnipotence, Yellow to his Omniscience and Blue to his Omnipresence, or, in other words, to his Power, Wisdom and Universality.</p>
<p>In relation to Man, the colour Red denotes courage, will and force; hence to dominion and power. It is also related to war and to each man’s fight with his passions. Yellow refers to intellect and knowledge, and thus to wisdom, and it is emblematical of calm, peace and gladness. Blue refers to honour, love, friendship and fidelity, hence to benevolence.</p>
<p>In the world around us we associate the colour Red with fire, with blood and wine and with the Ruby. Yellow with the sun’s rays, giving life to all animal and vegetable life, with gold, corn and oil, and with the Topaz. Blue with the vault of the cloudless heaven and the deep sea beneath it and with the Sapphire.</p>
<p>These three colours predominate in flowers and are supplemented by Orange, Purple and Violet; and Green is the almost universal colour of leaves and growing shoots of all vegetation. In symbolism Green refers to hope, progress, evolution and regeneration. It is typified by the Emerald.</p>
<p>Purple has become associated with Imperial Rule and dignity from its combination of power and love. Its emblem is the Amethyst.</p>
<p>Orange has been referred to zeal and enthusiasm and to mental and moral development and self-control. Violet is the colour referred to penitence, and Grey is symbolical of humility.</p>
<p>Brown is the colour of a large part of the solid earth on which we live, and is associated with durability, firmness, constancy and self-abnegation.</p>
<p>So the varied colours by which we are surrounded in Nature and which show forth the beauties of God’s creation, reveal to us something of the Beauty of His holiness,which it is our aim to reflect as best we can in our own lives.</p>
