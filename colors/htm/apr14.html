SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Most Learned Senior Knight Interpreter, explain to me the colour, and meaning of your banner.
</p><p>
SENIOR KNIGHT.—<br>
    It is <span class="color red">Red</span>, the colour of Judah, which signifies “Praise of the Lord.” Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise, thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies, thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp ; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up. He stooped down, he crouched down as a lion, who shall rouse him up ; the sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and to him shall the gathering of the people be. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes ; his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

JUNIOR KNIGHT.—<br>
    The colour of Reuben is <span class="color red">Red</span>, signifying the vision of the son. Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, and the excellence of power, but unstable as water, thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father’s couch.

    The banner of Ephraim is <span class="color green">Green</span>, its emblem the Ox, signifying, he that beareth fruit. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above my progenitors. Unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of him who was separated from his brethren.
</p><p>
SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Explain yours, Illustrious Knight Standard Bearer.
</p><p>
STANDARD BEARER.—<br>
    My Banner is <span class="color green">Green</span>, the colour of Dan, signifying judgment, or he that judges. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way—an adder in the path—that biteth the horses’ heels, so that the rider shall fall backwards.

Yours, illustrious Knight of Eloquence.
</p><p>
KNIGHT OF ELOQUENCE.—<br>
    <span class="color pink">Pink</span>, the colour of Mannasseh, signifying forgetfulness, or he that is forgotten. Joseph is a fruitful bough ; even a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him and hated him, but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the mighty God of Jacob.

SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Yours, Illustrious Knight Recorder?
</p><p>
HEIGHT RECORDER.—<br>
    <span class="color yellow">Yellow</span> is the colour of Simeon, meaning he that is heard. Simeon and Levi are brethren, instruments of cruelty are in their habitations, in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall. I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
</p><p>
SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Yours, Illustrious Knight of Finance.
</p><p>

SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Yours, Illustrious Knight of Introduction?
</p><p>
KNIGHT OF INTRODUCTION.—<br>
    <span class="color blue">Blue</span>, the colour of Issachar, signifying reward or recompense. Issachar is as a strong ass, crouching down between two burdens, and he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant, and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
</p><p>
SUBLIME GRAND COMMANDER.—<br>
Yours, Illustrious Knight Archivist?
</p><p>
