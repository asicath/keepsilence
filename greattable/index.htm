                Nalvage: There are 30 Calls yet to come. Those 30 are the Calls of Ninety one Princes and spiritual
                Governours, unto whom the Earth is delivered as a portion. These bring in and again disposes Kings and
                all the Governments upon the Earth, and vary the Natures of things: with the variation of every moment;
                Unto whom, the Providence of the eternal Judgement, is already opened. There are generally governed by
                the twelve Angles of the 12 Tribes: which are also governed by the 7 which stand before the presence of
                God. Let him that can see lookup: and let him that can here, attend; for this is wisdom. They are all
                spirits of the Air; not rejected, but dignified; and they dwell and have their habitation in the air
                diversly, and in sundry places; for their mansions are not alike, neither are their powers equal.
                Understand therefore, that from the fire to the earth, there are 30 places or abidings: one above and
                beneath another: wherein these aforesaid Creatures have their aboad, for a time.
                </p>

                    ...... But what they have, in respect of their being. Understand them therefore, by the first second, third ... so thirtieth Air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are so to be nominated, O thou the Twentieth air, O thou sixteenth Air, &c.

                In the line De Spiritu Sancto, you have 'A b i o r o' of six letters: The second name of the second

            <p>E.K. Prayed a short fervent prayer, whereat I rejoyced much.</p>
            <p>E.K. Now there commeth a beam from above into his head as big as my little finger.</p>
            <p>...... "And purpose Dlasod, take a swift Image, and have the proportion of a most glorious mixture Audcal and also Lulo. Continue and by office seek Rnodnr backward by the red digestion. But he by the common or red Darr doth gather most ripest work, purge the last fortune well fixed.

            <p>...... Two things you have to be instructed in, in Rlodnr, and in the Law of Coition and Mixture.</p>
            <p>The first, is the instrument working, and drawing things together of one nature. The second is the bounds and termes, wherein every mixture consisteth, and beyond the which it cannot go.</p>
            <p>The first of 4 parts, every part conteining, conteineth his conteined double.</p>
            <p>The first is Tepens, this teacheth the rest.</p>

            <p>Take common Audcal, purge and work it by Rlodnr of four divers digestions, continuing the last digestion for fourteen dayes, in one and a swift proportion, untill it be Dlasod fixed a most red and luminous body, the Image of Resurrestion.</p>
            <p>Take also Lulo of red Roxtan, and work him through the four fiery degrees, until thou have his Audcal, and there gather him.</p>
            <p>Then double every degree of your Rlodnr, and by the law of coition and mixture work and continue them diligently together. Notwithstanding backward, through every degree, multiplying the lower and last Rlodnr his due office finished by one degree more than the highest.</p>
            <p>So doth it become Darr, the thing you seek for: a holy, most glorious, red, and dignified Dlasod.</p>
            <p>But watch well, and gather him, so, at the highest: For in one hour, he descendeth, or ascendeth from the purpose.</p>

            <p>Δ. As I, and E.K. sat in my little study: after our talk of divers matters, and of my expecting audience at the Emperor his hand, &c. E.K. saw three little creatures walk up and down in the sun-shine, about an handfull from the pavement: and the creatures themselves very small, not an handfull long, like little shadows, or smokes, and the path wherein they walked seemed yellow. They walked a good while to and fro, till at length I suspected that they were sent to us; and so prepared the shew-stone: But E.K. said, he had rather see them thus out of the stone. I said that in the stone we have warrant that no wicked thing shall enter: but without the stone, Illuders might deal with us, unlesse God prevented it, &c.</p>
            <p>E.K. said again, he had rather deal thus.</p>
            <p>One of the 3 spiritual creatures said ...... His meaning is above thy sight.</p>
            <p>E.K. Now two of them seem to kneel down in the Sun beams.</p>
            <p>He in the middle of the Three ..... Blessed be God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, the most holy and blessed Trinity: One, true, mighty, perfect everlasting and incomprehensible God.</p>
            <p>[Δ. Amen, Amen, Amen]</p>
            <p>..... Which will be comprehended with those that live in the Heavens (the true Church of God) of such as measure him by faith, and not reason: which hath sent us to do his will; Both in that he will turn his heart: And in that he doth vouchsafe to make you witnesses of his secret purposes, and determinations in hand.</p>
            <p>1. The middlemost said ------ I am the midst of the third, and the last [Δ.] of the spirit of life. Understood in this temporal controversie, and conflict of man's soul: but not according to his eternal and immeasurable proportion.</p>
            <p>2. The second on the right side said ------ I am the second of the third, which dwell in the spirit, and power of God in earth: I have power to scourage them that resist the power, will, and commandment of God: and I am one of those that stand, and is perpetual.</p>
            <p>For even as the father, son, and holy spirit are one, but of themselves and being dilated, is full of power, and many. So are we one particularly in power, but separated; notwithstanding, spiritually, of, and amongst others, and dilated in the will of God, and into the branches of his determinations: but particularly living, and joyntly praising God.</p>
            <p>E.K. Now the other (the third) on the other side standeth up, and sayeth.</p>
            <p>3. ......... The Kingdom of God, and of his son Christ: (which is true God, and the substance of his father, True God of true God).</p>
            <p>E.K. What is that, God of God?</p>
            <p>E.K. They are disappeared: but their path appeareth in the aire, in the sun-beams still.</p>
            <p>E.K. They are here again.</p>
            <p>...... Is contrary to ye kingdome of this world.</p>
            <p>...... Happy are those that are of his Kingdom, for it hath no end; yea, happy are those that are the sons of faith, and not of the world: which is called Reason. Which is blinde, and is sealed with the mark of destruction. Because she persecuted, and put to death the Son of God, the God of righteousnesse, and light of all that live.</p>
            <p>[3.] ..... I am the last, of the first, of the fourth, and I have power to gather up the blessings of God, and to set them (if they be disdained) in a better soyl.</p>
            <p>3 [.....] For thus sayeth the God of Hoasts.</p>
            <p>If he dream and will not hear me Gather up that he hath, and that which should be given him: that his life may be short, and his house without comfort: that he may passe away nakedly, as a shadow.</p>
            <p>And lo, behold, we go, and we will dwell there; yea, even in the skirts of their Garments will we take up our habitation. And why?</p>
            <p>Behold, this hath God said: In the morning watch them, and see how they rise. In the day time give ear unto them, and listen unto their counsels. Stand over them in the night, and note their filthinesse. And when it exceedeth the number, strike.</p>
            <p>We are they that must direct your practises.</p>
            <p>...... Behold, let us give Testimony of our names.</p>
            <p>My name is ----- Ga ------ E.K. He in the middle.</p>
            <p>My name is ----- Za</p>
            <p>My name is ----- Vaa</p>
            <p>Δ. The three names make one name of 7 letters, Gazavaa.</p>
            <p>So we are called by position.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt find us amongst the mercifull Tables delivered unto Enoch: and so unto you.</p>
            <p>1. The middle most { I am on the third Table, and am extreme.</p>
            <p>2. { I am of the third, but of the humanitie, and the second. Δ. of the physick part. Δ. Note the third Table here meant, is that of the South, as East, West, South, and North, their placing is other.</p>
            <p>3. { And I am of the fourth, but Angular, and extreme, Linear of the uppermost. Δ. The three last Letters in the uppermost line of the fourth Table.</p>
            <p>---- We are gone. --- E.K. They are out of sight.</p>
